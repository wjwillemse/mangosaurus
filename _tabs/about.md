This is my personal blog site about data science in Python and Rust. I am a computer scientist and insurance mathematician, and currently work at De Nederlandsche Bank. My focus is on knowledge representation, explainable machine learning, natural language processing and data graphs.

The word mangosaurus was generated by a recurrent neural network that was trained with a list of dinosaur names (see this [Deep learning course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)). When the developers of the course ran the dinosaur names for some time their favorite name was the "great, undefeatable, and fierce: mangosaurus.

This word is the only computer generated word on this website. All content is written without the use of generative AI models.
